# fake-meeting-webcam
Streams low-quality video to a virtual camera

To use this you need some kind of virtual camera software installed, see https://pypi.org/project/pyvirtualcam/

Once the script is running, just use whatever software that uses your camera and switch the input to the virtual device the script is using

You might want to run `pip install opencv-python numpy pyvirtualcam`
